# Article recommendation system

The project explores a dataset from IBM and builds various recommender systems to recommend articles to new and existing users.

The main file is a Jupyter Notebook called `Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb`. The notebook has four main sections:

- I. Exploratory Data Analysis
- II. Rank Based Recommendations
- III. User-User Based Collaborative Filtering
- V. Matrix Factorization

## Results

Various recommendation models was tested and the accuracy of recommendations may not be good as there is a large imbalance in the dataset. Content based recommendations were not included but may provide better recommendations, especially for new users.

## Instructions

Libraries and virtual environment details are located in the `Pipfile` which can be used with `pipenv`.

Project based on Udacity Data Science Nanodegree.
